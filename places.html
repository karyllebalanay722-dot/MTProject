        <h1>DIOCESAN SHRINE AND PARISH OF SAN NICOLAS</h1>
        <p>Originally built in 1584, along with the founding of the town by Augustinian friars, San Nicolas Church has always been special. The town's first name, Visita de Caluntian, came from the many lanuti trees around. Father Antonio Villanueva gave the church a major upgrade in 1693. And get this on September 10, 2020, it was officially recognized as a diocesan shrine, thanks to Bishop Renato Mayugba's approval on July 21, 2020.</p>

        <h1>ROBINSONS ILOCOS</h1>
        <p>Robinsons Place Ilocos, which opened on December 3, 2009, is the first full-service mall in Ilocos Norte. Since its launch, it has become a central hub for shopping, dining, and entertainment in the region. Due to its strong performance and growing popularity, Robinsons Land Corporation expanded the mall in 2016 with the addition of a south wing. This expansion introduced more retail and dining options, as well as a BPO office component, catering to the increasing demand from both the local Ilocano community and tourists.
