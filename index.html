        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <p>In honor of Saint Nicholas de Tolentino, who was thought to have shielded the populace from typhoons, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other disasters, San Nicolas was given its current name in 1733.  The fact that only San Nicolas was named after a saint in Ilocos Norte is noteworthy.</p>

        <p>Augustinian missionaries founded San Nicolas in the province of Ilocos.  In 1572, Vigan was established as the first Spanish mission post in this area.  The indigenous people of San Nicolas and Laoag put up a fierce fight against the Spaniards when they first explored the Laoag (Padsan) River in 1575.  Another voyage left Vigan in 1584 and built San Nicolas, followed a year later by Laoag. </p>

        <p>One of the province's oldest structures is the San Nicolas Catholic Church, which was constructed in 1701.  One of the town's must-see attractions is its original construction.  The town center is made up of the Church, the Santa Rosa Academy Building that is adjacent to it, the well-preserved Municipal Hall, and the historic Town Plaza that is spread out between them. Earthen bricks, one of the products of the remaining residents, were used in the original construction of these buildings and structures and are being used today.
